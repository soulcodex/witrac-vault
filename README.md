## Considerations üïµ

1. The implementation of consumer for published domain events is not completed i just have been defined as an interface.
2. The [FileStatus](./src/Vault/Domain/File/FileStatus.php) could be better at least the behavior should
be migrated as enumerated and keep the business domain context.
3. Refactor [Custom Doctrine Types](./src/Shared/Infrastructure/Persistence/Doctrine) classes to avoid repeated logic.
4. Refactor input data validation controllers could be a great idea to establish a standard way to validate all
incoming data.
5. Refactor storage systems implementations and abstractions.
